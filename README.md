# tudo

A task manager based on GTD (Getting things done) Principles.

# Getting Things Done

[Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) is a personal productivity system developed by David Allen and published in a book of the same name.

For an understanding of the principles, use this [guide](https://hamberg.no/gtd/#readreview-folder).

# Features

Currently `tudo` only supports usage through command line arguments.

Following features are fully implemented:
- `in` list
- `next actions` list
- `projects`
- `contexts`
- `waiting for` list
- `someday` list
- `review`
- `read` list

## In Progress

A TUI for `tudo` is being implemented in the `dev` branch using [`tcell`](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/tree/main).
